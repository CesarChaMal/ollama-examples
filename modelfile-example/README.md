>>> How to implement HTTP security headers in a REST API
 There are several HTTP security headers that you can implement in your REST API to enhance its security. Here are some best practices for implementing these 
headers:
1. X-Frame-Options: This header helps prevent clickjacking attacks by specifying which domains are allowed to embed the response in a frame. For example, you can
set this header to "deny" or "sameorigin" to block all embedding or only allow embedding from the same origin as the response.
2. Content-Security-Policy (CSP): This header helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by specifying which sources of content are allowed to be executed 
in the browser. For example, you can set this header to "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'" to allow only scripts from the same origin as the response and inline
scripts to be executed.
3. X-Content-Type-Options: This header helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by specifying which content types are allowed to be executed in the 
browser. For example, you can set this header to "nosniff" to block the browser from sniffing the response content type and executing it as a script.
4. Strict-Transport-Security: This header helps ensure that all requests made to the API are encrypted using HTTPS or SSL/TLS. For example, you can set this 
header to "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" to require that all requests to the API use HTTPS for a period of 31,536,000 seconds (approximately 100 years) 
and include subdomains.
Here is an example of how you can implement these headers in your REST API using Node.js and Express:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
// Set X-Frame-Options header to deny embedding the response in a frame
res.header('X-Frame-Options', 'deny');
// Set Content-Security-Policy header to allow only scripts from the same origin as the response and inline scripts to be executed
res.header('Content-Security-Policy', "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'");
// Set X-Content-Type-Options header to block the browser from sniffing the response content type and executing it as a script
res.header('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
// Set Strict-Transport-Security header to require that all requests to the API use HTTPS for a period of 100 years
res.header('Strict-Transport-Security', "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains");
next();
});
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
res.sendFile(__dirname + '/views/index.html');
});
app.listen(3000, function() {
console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
In this example, the middleware function is used to set the HTTP security headers for each request. The "X-Frame-Options" header is set to "deny" to prevent 
clickjacking attacks, and the "Content-Security-Policy" header is set to allow only scripts from the same origin as the response and inline scripts to be 
executed. The "X-Content-Type-Options" header is set to block the browser from sniffing the response content type and executing it as a script. Finally, the 
"Strict-Transport-Security" header is set to require that all requests to the API use HTTPS for a period of 100 years.
